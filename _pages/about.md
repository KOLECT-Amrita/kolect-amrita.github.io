Kolect is a KnOwLEdge ConnecT platform for students to connect and share the ever-growing knowledge of their collecting hobbies. Collectible Hobbies bring a lot of value to individuals, from time management to knowledge sharing. In the era of the digital-virtual world, collectible hobbies shall bring in the required detachment from social media and digital gadgets. Through this club, we aspire to bring back the Collectible Hobbies to our university & schools in our locality and promote them by providing a platform to showcase their collectibles.
